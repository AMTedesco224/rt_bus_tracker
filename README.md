# rt_bus_tracker
Tracks a Boston bus route in real time with a map marker using mapbox. I used the MTBA api to retrieve the bus data and javascript to create the moving marker on the map.

## When open in the browser press the "Track Bus Location" button to add a marker to the map that updates the bus location every 10 seconds.

This application could be updated to view multiple bus routes at once or toggle through different bus routes in Boston for future development.
