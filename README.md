# rt_bus_tracker
Tracks a Boston bus route in real time with a map marker using mapbox. I used the MTBA api to retrieve the bus data and javascript to create the moving marker on the map.

## When open in the browser press the "Track Bus Location" button to add a marker to the map that updates the bus location every 10 seconds.
